# pyKnit
A set of tools for knitters to do math, create charts, and eventually more.

## Usage

pyKnit works best in conjunction with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install).
This allows you to "mess around" with the functions and see the results in your
browser.  I like this especially for the ability to display the charts inline.
Make sure you install jupyter and pyknits in the same place (e.g. in the same
virtualenv if you're using one) so that you can use `import pyknit` and have it
work.

If you don't want to use Jupyter, it will also work as any standard python library.
